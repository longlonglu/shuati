[1197. Minimum Knight Moves](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-knight-moves/)
___

## 分析问题
* It's ok to use a single BFS, but it will return TLE or MLE

## 基本思路
* Two way BFS is same as normal BFS.
* We expand the graph from both statring point and ending point
* We have 2 queues and 2 hashMaps
* Once we found there is a coordinate that is in both hashMaps, we can return the total steps.
* We don't need to care about the shortest distance, because we are using BFS and the weight of every edge is the same. So which one come first will be the answer
