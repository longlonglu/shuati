[1254. Number of Closed Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-closed-islands/)
___


## 基本思路
* 0 is land, 1 is water.
* If we see land at edge and expand it. We will able to mark a unqualify closed land.
* Then, rest of land in the grid will must be valid

```python
class Solution:
    def closedIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        
        
        def dfs(grid, row, col):
            if 0 <= row < len(grid) and 0 <= col < len(grid[0]) and grid[row][col] == 0:
                grid[row][col] = 1
                dfs(grid, row - 1, col)
                dfs(grid, row + 1, col)
                dfs(grid, row, col - 1)
                dfs(grid, row, col + 1)
