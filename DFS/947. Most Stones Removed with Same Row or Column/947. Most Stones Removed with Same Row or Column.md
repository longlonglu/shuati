[947. Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-stones-removed-with-same-row-or-column/)
___

## 分析问题
* Once you know this question, you will find that's really easy.
* The question is how you find the pattern?

## 基本思路
* Connected stones can be reduced to 1 stone, the maximum stones can be removed = stones number - islands number. so just count the number of "islands".
* But how to find the island?
* If we have 2 maps `rowMap` and `colMap`
* `rowMap[0] = [(0,1), (0,3)]` means there exists two stones at row 0.
* Same meanning with `colMap`
* For real `numOfIsland` question, the rule is if one of four directions is 1, we expand.
* In this question:
* We loop over all the stones.
* We mark all stones with same row, and col as visited
