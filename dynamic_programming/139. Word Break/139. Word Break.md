[139. Word Break](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/)
___


## 基本思路
* `dp[i] == True` mean we already checked `s[0: i+1]` and we can find the correspond word in `word_set`
* `if s[i: j] in word_set and dp[i]:` this line is really important.'

```
Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
Output: false
```
* Take above example.
* The last word is dog, and we have dog in `word_set`, but its still not the answer

```python
class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:
        dp = [False] * (len(s) + 1)
        dp[0] = True
        
        word_set = set(wordDict)
        
        for i in range(len(s)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
                if s[i: j] in word_set and dp[i]:
                    dp[j] = True
                    
        return dp[-1]
