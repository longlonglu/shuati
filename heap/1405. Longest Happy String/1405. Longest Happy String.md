[1405. Longest Happy String](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-happy-string/)
___


## 基本思路
* This is same as [767. Reorganize String](https://github.com/longlonglu/shuati/blob/main/heap/767.%20Reorganize%20String/767.%20Reorganize%20String.md).
* Have a maxHeap.
* If `answer[-2]` == `answer[-1]` == `char1`, we know this `char1` is not ok, get next char
