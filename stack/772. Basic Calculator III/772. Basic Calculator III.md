[227. Basic Calculator II](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator-ii/)

## 基本思路
* Above two questions are the same as this one.
* The import key is we do the layback calculate.
* For example the input is `2 + 3 * 4` the answer is 14
* We first set the `operation` to `+` because it's a `+2`
* Then next round when we see another operator, we push the `currentNum` into `stack`
* Now our stack contains a positive 2.
* Next round, our `currentNum` is `3`, and the `operation` is `+`, we push positive 3 into stack
* Next round, our `currentNum` is `4`, and the `operation` is `*`, we pop one from stack which is 3 and * `currentNum`
